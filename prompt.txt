Can you write me a Must Know document in MarkDown of everything you need to know to effectively use <NMAP> like a penetration professional. Explain in detail the most used parameters in this tool. Come up with examples. Explain this all assuming the other person also know a fair amount of this topic and skip any installation step. After reading this the reader should know how to use the tool and is ready to solve hard CTFs.  


allow me to download this output as a md-file by opening a python terminal and creating a script that will write the md file out of the Must-Know Guide in string format. Thanks

## Must Know: Penetration Testing with Nikto, Dirbuster, Dirb & Gobuster

---

### 1. Nikto

Nikto is a web server scanner that detects vulnerabilities in web servers. It can find issues like outdated software, potential misconfigurations, and more.

**Common Parameters**:

- `-h`: Specify a host (can be an IP or domain)
- `-p`: Specify a port or port range
- `-nossl`: Disables SSL
- `-output`: Write the output to a file
- `-Tuning`: Scan tuning to specify which types of tests to run

**Example**:

Scan a website on port 80:

```
nikto -h www.example.com -p 80
```

### 2. Dirbuster

Dirbuster is a multi-threaded Java application that brute-forces directories and file names on web applications.

**Common Parameters**:

- `-u`: URL target
- `-l`: List of directories or files
- `-e`: File extension or extensions to search for
- `-t`: Number of threads
- `-r`: Recurse into directories

**Example**:

Brute-force directories on a website using a wordlist:

```
java -jar DirBuster-1.0-RC1.jar -u http://www.example.com -l /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50
```

### 3. Dirb

Dirb is a command-line tool similar to Dirbuster, which uses a built-in wordlist to find directories and files.

**Common Parameters**:

- `-w`: Use a custom wordlist
- `-X`: Add file extension to requests
- `-r`: Don't recurse into directories
- `-i`: Show only results with these HTTP codes

**Example**:

Scanning with a custom wordlist and appending .php extension:

```
dirb http://www.example.com /path/to/wordlist.txt -X .php
```

### 4. Gobuster

Gobuster is a directory/file, DNS subdomain, and VHost brute-forcing tool written in Go.

**Common Parameters**:

- `dir`: Use directory and file brute-forcing mode
- `-u`: URL target
- `-w`: Path to wordlist
- `-x`: File extension(s) to search for
- `-k`: Skip SSL certificate verification
- `-t`: Set the number of threads

**Example**:

Directory brute-forcing with custom wordlist and extensions:

```
gobuster dir -u http://www.example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -x php,html,js -k -t 50
```

### When to use which tool:

1. **Nikto vs. Others**:
   - **Nikto** is specialized in finding web server vulnerabilities, unlike the other tools which are specialized in directory brute-forcing.
   - Use **Nikto** when you aim to identify web server misconfigurations or outdated software.

2. **Dirbuster vs. Dirb**:
   - **Dirbuster** is GUI-based (though it has CLI) and is written in Java, which can be slower.
   - **Dirb** is CLI-based, lightweight, and faster than Dirbuster.
   - Use **Dirbuster** when you prefer a graphical representation. Use **Dirb** for quick CLI-based scans.

3. **Dirb vs. Gobuster**:
   - **Gobuster** is more versatile as it can do directory and file brute-forcing, DNS subdomain enumeration, and VHost enumeration.
   - **Gobuster**, being written in Go, is faster and more efficient in handling large wordlists due to its concurrency model.
   - Use **Dirb** for simpler, lightweight directory brute-forcing. Use **Gobuster** for more comprehensive and faster scans or when DNS and VHost brute-forcing is required.

In summary, your choice between these tools will largely depend on your specific needs and preferences. Ensure you're always acting ethically and have permission when performing penetration tests. Happy hunting!

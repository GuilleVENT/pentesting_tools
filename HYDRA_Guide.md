# Hydra - A Penetration Tester's Guide

Hydra is a versatile brute-forcing tool that can help penetration testers and ethical hackers in their assessments. This guide dives into its usage, parameters, and examples to make the most out of the tool.

## 1. Overview
Hydra supports a myriad of services, including SSH, FTP, HTTP, RDP, and many more. It can use both dictionary and brute force attacks to identify valid login credentials.

## 2. Commonly Used Parameters

- `-l` / `-L`: specifies a single login or a file with a list of logins.
- `-p` / `-P`: specifies a single password or a file with a list of passwords.
- `-s`: specifies the port if it's non-standard for the service.
- `-o`: write the found login/password pairs to this file.
- `-t`: number of parallel connections per target. 
- `-w`: defines the wait time between the login attempts.
- `-vV`: verbose mode, shows login attempts (`-vV` shows all attempts).
- `-f`: exit after the first found login/password pair.
- `-e`: additional password checks. For instance, `-e ns` would try null passwords and the login as the password.
- `-u`: for services like `http-post-form`, where login is not in the form `user:pass`, but rather different field names.
- `-M`: for parallel attacks on multiple hosts.
- `-R`: restore a previous aborted/crashed session.
- `-C`: for colon-separated "login:pass" format, useful for using outputs directly.

## 3. Examples

### 3.1 SSH brute-forcing:
```
hydra -l username -P /path/to/passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.1
```

### 3.2 FTP brute-forcing:
```
hydra -L /path/to/usernames.txt -P /path/to/passwords.txt ftp://192.168.1.1
```

### 3.3 HTTP POST Form brute-forcing:

Let's say the login request looks like this: `username=admin&password=secret&submit=Login`.

```
hydra -L /path/to/usernames.txt -P /path/to/passwords.txt 192.168.1.1 http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Login failed"
```

In the example above, the failure condition `Login failed` helps Hydra know when a login attempt has failed. The `^USER^` and `^PASS^` placeholders are where Hydra will place usernames and passwords from the list.

### 3.4 RDP brute-forcing:
```
hydra -t 4 -l administrator -P /path/to/passwords.txt rdp://192.168.1.1
```

### 3.5 Restore an aborted session:

```
hydra -R
```


## 4. Tips and Tricks

- Always be cautious with the `-t` parameter, as setting it too high can cause services to crash or lockout accounts due to multiple failed login attempts.
  
- Customize your wordlists based on the target. Generic wordlists might not always be effective.

- Monitor network traffic using tools like Wireshark when attacking web forms. This helps in understanding the request/response format and any additional parameters/headers that may be required.

- Remember that using Hydra or any brute-forcing tool without permission is illegal. Always have written consent before conducting any security assessments.

## 5. Conclusion

Hydra is a powerful tool in a penetration tester's arsenal when used appropriately. Understanding its parameters and tailoring them for the specific use-case is crucial for success. Happy hacking, and always hack ethically!
